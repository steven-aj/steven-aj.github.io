Here's a list of self-hosted FOSS tools I use daily. If these don't tickle your fancy, you can find many, *many more* useful tools over at [Awesome-Selfhosted](https://awesome-selfhosted.net/).

## 🖥️ Homarr

A hub. A homepage. A quick access to everything when home. 

Homarr is my distraction-free dashboard to all of my apps and services. It's a gateway to everything listed here, plus external sites like Codeberg, GitHub, school and more.

## 🛜 CommaFeed

RSS is the closest I want to get to doom scrolling.

CommaFeed helps me keep up with the news and blogs that I'm most interested in.

## 📑 Readeck

I have a huge collection of in-browser bookmarks for quick reference, but Readeck is one of my most valuable research utilities.

I use this to gather, sort and highlight useful information on various topics I want to write about.

## 🧾 Answer

My wife and I are always discussing things we want to buy for the house and ourselves. 

Answer is a great to for us to build a generic list of things we want (questions), catalogue brands and offers (answers), discuss pros and cons of everything (comments), and choose the options we like the most (best answer).

## 💲Maybe

We like to have a biweekly, retrospective overview of all of our finances in one place. 

Maybe gives is all of that and handy budgeting tools to keep us on track with spending and expectations. I don't use the AI feature, but I guess it's there if I ever change my mind?

## 🔗 Syncthing

Syncthing helps keep my work and personal documents nicely synced between all of my devices. 

My home server hosts a master service bridged to a mounted NAS share where everything ultimately lives.

## 🗄️ Paperless-NGX

We've had a filing cabinet for years, and will probably always have one for important paperwork and mail. 

For now, Paperless keeps track of the rest, storing copies in a NAS share that's synchronized with a secure cloud service. Eventually, we'll have everything digitized.
