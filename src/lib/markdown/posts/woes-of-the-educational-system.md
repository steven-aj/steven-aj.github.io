My wife & I spent some time talking about our woes with the educational system today. She's in her Master's program and I'm returning for a career change after a multi-year stent in technology. Par for the course, I caught myself going on and on (and on) about the way most higher-ed is set up. For a variety of reasons, I don't like the systems.

One of our biggest shared complaints is in the way that rote memorization of content is expected in such a short time frame. Her major, for example, isn't involved in research - yet she, her colleagues *and* her superiors agreed that a few of the components in some of her most recent assignments were for the sake of research. Many of them couldn't clarify some of the information within and at least one of them (her superior) is well-established in her field.

So... why the hell is she conducting research when her career & education are both in application? Mind you - she's pretty damn good at what she does, but the GPA demands of a Master's program (hers, at least) are wildly stringent for something irrelevant to what she's actually attending for. She needs an 85 or better to pass each quarter. Absurd.

Meanwhile, I'm cramming three weeks worth of Mathematics while struggling with what feels like bullying "gotchas" delivered from on-high in MathLab to gear up for a *closed-book test*. *What the ever-loving fuck is that?*

I've been in the workforce for nearly twenty years now, spanning dirty skilled labor to comfy office jobs. Never - in the near two decades that I've been working - have I encountered a situation where I couldn't search for a solution (or at least an avenue for one). How the hell is closed-book testing still a requirement of higher-ed when a) *it doesn't apply to real world situations* and b) *cramming information has been redundantly proven to be a terrible learning strategy*?

In the end, we both agreed that the whole thing is like a [Shape Sorter that doesn't give a shit about which shape is dropped in which hole](https://youtube.com/shorts/HYHfMDjUks8?si=s5vT4WQGpIe2y1i1) - **the educational system is contradictorily built against its own research-based constraints**.

Don't get me wrong - my particular school is supportive on nearly every front. Need writing help? There's a center for that. Struggling with concepts in Math? There's a center for that. It's like an App Store of assistance and the effort by the administration is truly amazing in this regard. 

The demand, though, for rote memorization of new concepts *without a realistic avenue of exploration* (especially in high-stress environments), and the irrelevant material a student has to wade through *strictly for a letter-grade* just feels like another big-ass organization making profit-oriented decisions: your failure is their success, and your success is their success. Whether you're paying out the ass because you didn't fit the mold the first time around or you're being filmed walking across the stage for their next marketing campaign, *they have nothing to lose*. You, on the other hand, have potentially thousands of dollars* and *many hours of your life to lose if you get it wrong.

... C'est la vie, I guess?
