Today has been one hell of a push. 

Once upon a time, I could've sprinted through a day with just a few hours of sleep. These days, getting six or fewer completely kicks my ass and today, I've been barely crawling on just four hours. I'm pretty sure I fell asleep in class this morning (which is kind of embarrassing because I tend to snore like a bear), but hey - I still made it to the gym, so there's that. 

Apart from today's grind, I spent the weekend battling with my mobile carrier over a dishonored trade-in promotion that was supposed to have been credited to my account until the end of my contract. For some reason, however, I've been paying full price for the damned thing since January - a blunder **confirmed to be a blunder by agents themselves**. Calling customer support led to the usual "exhaustion run-around" - y'know, where they keep you on hold for a good hour, hoping you'll give up, before making false promises of resolution and sending you on your way.

After several hours of getting nowhere, I decided to launch a formal complaint through the FCC this morning. Lo and behold! The carrier's executive office called me just a few hours later, promising (which was probably bullshit, too) to get back in touch within twenty-four to forty-eight hours. If they don't, I'll be launching another complaint. 

Someday, I'll draft an essay on the fucked up tactics these companies use (to basically make you willingly shut the hell up) and what your legal rights are (if living in the U.S., anyway). I'm not a lawyer, granted, but I've dealt with shitty telecom practices enough to know what gets their attention. If you've never had the absolute luxury of dealing with them, though, (*definitely sarcasm*) I would encourage you to do a bit of research on the topic. It's pretty shady shit and they can generally get away with it because they're one of only three major carriers in the nation.

Long story short: you do have rights, but very little power. If they find that they can fuck you over with minimal consequences, they have no qualms doing it.

I've said it once, and I'll say it again: Cyberpunk was a warning. The dystopia is here - and probably here to stay if Open Source and decentralization don't make the headway I hope they will. Not crypto, though. Please not crypto.

That said, the weekend wasn't all bad. Aside from the telecom crap, my wife and I had a pretty wonderful few days together; took a stroll at our favorite park, tried some new food, got some shopping done and shared a few laughs. I've got plenty to bitch about, but it was still a really great three-day stay-cation.

In any case, wish me luck with this shit. Hopefully the situation doesn't draw out much longer.

Take care, you - and have an awesome week.

Update #1:

Allegedly, the carrier problem is being resolved later this week. I've finally received a case number and have been told to expect a follow-up once everything has been taken care of. Fingers crossed!

Update #2:

Missed the call, which coincidentally came just thirty minutes before their office closed. Maybe I'm just cynical. Maybe they're a dick.

Update #3:

Finally heard back. They claim the situation has been resolved. Things look better on my end. I guess we'll see how things really are moving forward.
