My wife bought me a NAS for my birthday this year. Until last week, I've mostly been using it to bridge changes between devices. One of my dreams has always been to have a server on our home network because I wanted a reliable gateway to self-hosted FOSS and home-brewed solutions.

As of last week, I now have a dedicated Fedora Server that I can SSH into on a whim. I've had a blast setting up all of the tools I know we'll use and looking into things that we might be interested in.

Today, we did a quick trial-run of scanning a few documents from our old filing cabinet into Paperless-NGX to get a feel for how quickly we could digitize things. It'll be a bit of work, but worth it all in the end - especially since the new NAS (where Docker volumes inevitably go) supports encrypted cloud backups for added redundancy.

Beyond the kick-off on securing all of our important paperwork, we've also started managing our finances through Maybe - a pretty drastic difference from the instance of Firefly III that I hosted on my workstation last year. If you haven't heard about Maybe, I would highly recommend checking it out.

Since we're both in school, I've also set up a Docker container with Readeck to help aggregate our researched material for various assignments. I'll be using this for some more formal essays that I have in the works to be published here, as well.

Syncthing, bridged to the NAS by the server, keeps everything nicely synchronized for all of my devices. This feels like a better solution than accessing shares directly via SMB, but perhaps not quite as robust. I haven't fully weighed the cons yet, but I'm loving it so far. It's certainly more convenient than manually moving files around.

Homarr keeps everything organized in individual boards for us to access the different apps we use  - including various social forums and links to our school's LMS of choice. Having this as the default homepage in Vivaldi is super convenient. 

Despite the time required to install and configure everything, my productivity has already begun improving. Cross-device synchronization, finance management, research hold, and digitizing our paperwork has been pretty remarkable - all on a home-storage device. Slowly but surely, we're owning our data again.

Our little homelab had become indispensable within a matter week, and I'm excited to explore more of this side of my development skills.

Long live FOSS. *Long live ownership.*
