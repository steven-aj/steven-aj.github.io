Last year, I was interviewed for an in-house engineering position tasked with building educational resources for a local school district. As with most interviews these days, the discussion eventually turned to AI and I was a little blown away by the lead engineer's perspective. 

Long story short: they weren't under the impression that AI was a threat or that it could be any time soon. I argued that, with the many billions of dollars being thrown at the subject - and with some of the brightest minds in the industry working on it - the question of "if" wasn't quite as pertinent as "when". I even went as far as pointing out that software was among the most lucrative ventures when done right, and that full autonomy of development would be the Holy Grail of industry profits. They simply weren't buying it. 

They claimed that we "just aren't there yet". I didn't argue with that. In terms of output, we simply aren't. But where we are today is but little reflection of where we'll be in the next ten years - and the rate of growth, adoption and evolution far surpasses anything I've seen in the industry in my last decade of professional experience or two decades of general experience overall. 

My point is: even industry professionals are having difficulties in understanding where our working value seems to stand moving forward (including me). I can't say for certainty what the future will look like - nobody can, of course - but I'm confident in the sum of resources being thrown at the technology. If you think change is already here, I would argue that the next 10-15 years is going to dramatically surprise you.
