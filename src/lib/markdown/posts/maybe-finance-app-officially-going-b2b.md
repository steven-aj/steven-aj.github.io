Maybe Finance sunsets development of open-source finance tracker *Maybe* today in a lengthy goodbye to its community as it begins its pivot into B2B forecasting and scenario planning.

> This is a huge project and we couldnâ€™t have gotten this far without our early supporters and OSS contributors.

This decision comes in light of Maybe's struggle to maintain profitability as a B2C finance tool, Josh Pigford, founder of Maybe shared on X today. 

> Weâ€™re about 6,000 paying customers short of breaking even, with only around 200 paying customers currently, most of whom joined during the beta phases when the cost was significantly lower. We likely need more than 6,000 when you consider that many resources will need to scale up to meet the needs of that many more customers.

It isn't the first pivot Maybe has made. 

Originating as a closed-source tool reportedly approaching $1 million in startup costs, the project transitioned to open-source mid-2023 after "the business end of things didn't work out", according to the repo's original [backstory](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/blob/zachgoll%2Fpartial-syncs/README.md).

Pigford believes the next best transition is B2B forecasting and scenario planning, leaning heavily into the AI integrations made since the project's inception.

> Specifically, we're focusing on natural-language, generative-UI + UX for creating reports and answering questions.

### The Community's Next Move

Over the last few years, Maybe has garnered the attention of many self-hosting and financial enthusiasts, and much of the community has already begun forking the project's remains in a friendly race toward Maybe's former glory in popularity.

At the time of this writing, the now `Publicly Archived` repo has seen more than 4,000 forks. The most prominent of them appears to be [Sure](https://github.com/we-promise/sure) by the newly-created GitHub organization [we-promise](https://github.com/we-promise), which already boasted a non-trivial 95 stars on the day of Maybe's departure. 

If you're interested in joining the community, Sure welcomes any and all self-hosters, contributors, finance gurus and general users alike to their [Discord](https://discord.gg/36ZGBsxYEK) channel. For more information about Sure, head over to the [repo](https://github.com/we-promise/sure) and check out the README.

As a self-host user of Maybe, I wish Josh and his incredibly powerful project all the best. In the meantime, I'll be looking forward to what we can bring to the future of Sure.
