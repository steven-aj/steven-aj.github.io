My family never went all-out on fireworks for the holidays, but we were known to occasionally splurge from time to time. The reservation was  largely because one of my family members nearly lost their head to a premature mortar departure some time before I was born. Papa said the near-incident tamed the buzz for him with the big ones, but we were also pretty poor and, well, *they're damned expensive for what they are*. 

Nevertheless, I enjoyed what chances I got with fireworks when I was a kid. 

Mortars were obviously a rare buy, but both exciting and mesmerizing to experience when we got them. Holding an active Roman Candle felt like *actual wizardry*, complete with a touch of angst that I might have a grip on the *one wand* with some crazed, spiritually malicious desire to maim its lesser wielder. The little rocket cars kind of sucked, though. 

It was all a memorable experience, in any case.

Fast-forward 20+ years and my opinions reflect a different mind. These days, I teeter on the fulcrum of sensibilities, practicality, and respect for the freedoms of others.

Every year, neighborhoods all around take full advantage of their early chances to buy-in on the explosive fun. Independence Day is just around the corner so, naturally, I'm listening to them while writing this from the comfort of my living room couch. On some level, it's kind of nice to be able to step onto my balcony for a free show early in the night. My wife and I have enjoyed sharing more than a handful of moments doing so. **Early in the night.** 

You get the gist of where this next part is going.

I genuinely believe people should be able to do as they please as long as they aren't hurting anyone or anything in the process. If you want to set fire to thousands of dollars in the middle of your street, I honestly think you should have the right to do it. Just don't burn down anyone's house, of course (your own included). Want to teach your kid how to safely light a fuse with a punk? Go for it. *I don't have to agree with your principles* to agree that you and I both deserve our freedoms.

That said - *we do have laws* - and I'm not an asshole for expecting you to obey them. When an otherwise friendly neighborhood still sounds like a war zone at two in the morning, *you're breaking those laws*, and *you're* the asshole for expecting everyone else to be okay with it. You really shouldn't be detonating explosive before the legal firework date to begin with, but that's less of an offense, in my opinion, than a blatant lack of consideration for the rest of society well after Quiet Hours. This is my "Grumpy Old Man" Problem #1.

Problem #2 is rooted in practicality, but fundamentally overlaps with the issue of inconsideration. **It leaves a hell of a mess.**

Around this time every year, I'm either weaving around plastic debris on residential roads or scoffing at the garbage strewn about our local parks. Sure, much of the remnants may be tiny, biodegradable, paper casings, but *it's still litter* - a potential hazard for wildlife and *definitely* an eyesore. The trash left behind which *isn't* biodegradable is another level of assholery altogether.

I get it, though. *They're explosives*. If they *didn't* send shit in every direction when the fuse bottomed out, you'd be justified in feeling frustrated for legitimately wasting your money. This is where the "practicality" piece (or lack thereof) comes into play, though. You should certainly do what you'd like with your hard-earned cash but, when cleaning up after yourself becomes so impractical that it edges on being *nearly impossible*, then it becomes objectively arguable that you aren't spending your money practically - even if you can afford it financially.

Problem #3 is more of a matter of empathy than of how much of an asshole I think you might be, though the two aren't mutually exclusive. 

You see, **veterans come from (and return to) many walks of life**. Some of them have been in *real war zones, and have had to take lives to avoid losing their own*. They know damned well what "bombs bursting in air" *really* means, and they've had the misfortune of learning it so we don't have to.

Unfortunately, this is the part where my thoughts on the matter will inevitably tread on your freedom because I care more about their condition than I do about your personal enjoyment. If, in the end, the ones around you say that it doesn't bother them, then so be it. I'm not here to speak on their behalf. *But I know it bothers some of them*. I've witnessed it first-hand. If you don't care about the veterans it does bother, then you probably don't realize the type of asshole you truly are - even if you're fully prepared to own being one.

At my age, fireworks and the freedom to use them are both growing to be strange concepts. Freedoms are of utmost value to me, but so are the people of society that benefit from having them.

I suppose that's why I never majored in any social sciences. It's one hell of a complicated thing.
