Occasionally, my wife and I like to take turns picking YouTube videos to watch while we wind down at the end of a long day. I don't believe in shelling out money to a corporation that's *already* making billions from the time of their contributors so - needless to say - we don't pay for their premium subscription. (To be clear, I also don't shit on anyone who does. Ads are a nuisance. I get it.) Instead, we skip the ads as quickly as the countdown permits. 

Tonight, I saw one for Meta that was an immediate trigger.

A father and a his son are sitting at the island in their kitchen. Dad says, "Hey, Meta. How can I get my son to eat his breakfast?" A smart speaker sitting on the island responds, "He likes faces on his pancakes," or some basic mess along that line. I'm paraphrasing here. Anyway, the ad ends with a dinner plate entering the scene, complete with a cute bear-head shaped pancake atop.

Look - I understand. Kids can be picky eaters and, to be real, they probably haven't developed the foresight to realize how slogging through their morning on an empty stomach is likely going to effect their day. But when a fucking *smart speaker* can share more insight about your kid than you've developed in the years you've spent raising them, you probably need to re-evaluate more than the geometry on their plate.

AI governing the way we interact and learn with our kids is crazy to me. Leaning into technology to collect data on our families so it can shed some mindless, algorithmic insight on the household's likes & dislikes is a new level of disconnection that I feel the world could do without. 

Most of us already fumble through our daily interactions after years of having our social acuity inadvertently warped by corporate marketing bubbles. The thought of each of us being our own *individual bubble within our own families* paints a sad, bleak & dysfunctional dystopia that straight up puts Orwell to shame.

Of all people, children deserve the absolute highest standards in online privacy. The fact that Meta would peddle their surveillance equipment in opposition of that is a testament to how awful they really are. 

Every day seems more and more like Cyberpunk was more of a warning than a game. Someday soon, I think I'll churn up an article on how FOSS can free ourselves from the corporate tech bullshit. I've been wanting to talk about a community tandem to that, anyway.
