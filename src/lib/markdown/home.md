### Open Code. Neon Dreams.

You've found my digital garden - a place rooted in authenticity and nurtured by a love for software. This is my place to think, reflect, connect, and contribute. Consume what you need & leave the rest.

There's no tracking here and no spin. It's not a portfolio & it's not for profit - just raw thoughts, deep dives and occasional open-source news. 

**Welcome, Void Walker**. 

*May peace find you in the most chaotic of places.*
