It's only been a year since I built my last application. It was a self-hosted service for my wife and me to help keep track of some health-related metrics.

Today, I contemplated rebuilding and publishing it as a self-hosted FOSS solution, but it seems that I've lost pretty much all of the interest and wonder that I used to have in digging through mounds of documentation of different changes made over the year.

After working for companies ranging from WordPress to Node houses, it kind of feels like the passion that I used to have now belongs to the #indieweb. Moving forward, I think I'll just help solve problems instead. Maybe I'll push to more to existing open-source stuff, too.
