### Open-source focused

A decade of professional experience, more than twenty years of overall experience, and the sudden rise of AI has taught me one thing: **community above all**. 

Open-source development & support is my way of connecting with, giving to and leaving my mark on the world.

### üåê Supporter of the #indieweb

The internet was once a place for everyone; _really_ for everyone. 

Websites were self-hosted, personal spaces that reflected personality, time, commitment, and digital explorations - _not_ professionalism, corporate agendas or algorithmic conformity.

It can still be a place for everyone beyond the corporate orchestration of societal networks, and I'm happy to lend a hand in making it so.  

### üîí Advocate for digital autonomy and privacy

We don't need an all-in-one, cloud-backed solution to keep and maintain our data.

Self-hosted applications, local-first databases, and old school digital management gives control, privacy, and autonomy back to the people - where I believe it belongs.

### üêß _Linux user for life_

All things Fedora. All things RedHat. All things Unix. 

Long live Linux.
